# Plausible Anlytics on HTTPS

This [Docker Compose][docker-compose] configuration will run a self-hosted
instance of Plausible.io with geolocation enabled and [Traefik][traefik] as a
reverse-proxy, allowing you to serve the app on HTTPS.

## Pre-requisites

You will need is a server with [Docker][docker] and Docker Compose
installed.

To enable geolocation, you will need a [MaxMind][maxmind] **free** account. Sign
up and log in, then go to `Services â–¸ My License Key` and generate a new license
key. You will need the Account/User ID and key later.

## Configuration

- Set up your server as described above and SSH into it
- Clone this repository
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/devarinb/docker-plausible.git
  ```
- Edit the `geoip/geoip.conf` file and replace placeholders with the
  credentials from MaxMind
- Change the `traefik/acme.json` file permissions
  ```shell
  chmod 600 traefik/acme.json
  ```
- Edit the `traefik/traefik.toml` file and change the placeholder email address
  with your own
- Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and change the placeholder domain name with
  your own
- Edit the `plausible-conf.env` file and replace placeholders with your desired
  values
  - Remember to set the `https` protocol for your `BASE_URL`
  - To generate a good `SECRET_KEY_BASE` use this command
    ```
    openssl rand -base64 64
    ```

## Run

To start all services, just run the startup script: `./start.sh`.

You can verify that the the reverse-proxy is up and running by visiting
`<http://your.domain.com:8080>`.

## After the first successful run

Disable Traefik dashboard, or it will be publicly availabe in production.

To do that:

- Edit `traefik/traefik.toml` and remove the `[api]` section
- Edit `traefik/docker-compose.traefik.yml` and remove the line `"8080:8080"`
